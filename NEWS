info. To use this with the api see ok_write_scan_map().

** In the api add okp_ndef_as_text() to export the text from a OK_NDEF structure.

okp_ndef_alloc(), okp_ndef_free() and okp_set_ndef_access_code()
also providing compatible name OK_NDEF in okcore.h and exporting
ok_write_ndef() there.
Change return values from ndef_construct_*() functions to make them
consistent with the rest of the library.

Use okp_configure_version() instead of okp_configure_for() to set the version.
Use okp_configure_command() instead of okp_configure_for() to set slot.
